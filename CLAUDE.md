# godom

Local GUI apps in Go using the browser as the rendering engine. Minimal JS — most apps need none, plugins bridge JS libraries when needed.

## Project scope
- All file edits must stay within this project directory (and `/tmp` if needed)
- Do not modify files outside this project directory

## Architecture
- Go package (`godom`) that developers import
- User owns the HTTP server and mux; godom registers /ws and /godom.js handlers on it
- Virtual DOM in Go: templates parsed once, resolved per render, diffed for minimal patches
- Binary WebSocket connection (Protocol Buffers) between browser and Go
- Go → browser: `ServerMessage` with tree init, diff patches (`DomPatch`), or ExecJS calls
- Browser → Go: `BrowserMessage` for input sync, method calls, ExecJS results, and `godom.call`
- State lives in the Go process, survives browser close/reopen
- Single binary output via `go build`; QuickServe for simple apps, SetMux+Run+ListenAndServe for full control

## Internal packages
- `godom.go` — public API: Engine, SetFS, SetMux, Register(comp), Run, QuickServe(comp), ListenAndServe, SetAuth, Cleanup, Component (with TargetName, Template fields), Refresh, MarkRefresh, ExecJS
- `internal/vdom/` — VDOM node types, template parsing, tree resolution, diffing, merging
- `internal/component/` — component struct, Info, method dispatch, field access
- `internal/server/` — EngineConfig interface, BuildComponentInfo, WebSocket handling, connection pool, init/update pipeline
- `internal/render/` — encode patches to protobuf DomPatch, encode trees to JSON wire format
- `internal/template/` — HTML parsing, component expansion, directive validation
- `internal/bridge/` — bridge.js (DOM construction, patch execution, event handling)
- `internal/proto/` — protocol.proto, generated Go types, protocol.js, protobuf.min.js
- `internal/env/` — environment config utilities (GODOM_* env var readers)
- `internal/middleware/` — pluggable auth (AuthFunc, TokenAuth)
- `internal/utils/` — shared helpers (LocalIP, PrintQR, OpenBrowser)

## Critical invariants
- **IDCounter must never reset.** Each VDOM node gets a unique integer ID from `IDCounter`. The bridge's `nodeMap[id] → DOM node` depends on IDs being globally unique. Resetting the counter (e.g. `ci.IDCounter = &vdom.IDCounter{}` in `BuildUpdate`) causes new subtrees to reuse IDs of existing nodes, silently corrupting the bridge's nodeMap and breaking all subsequent patches. See `TestIDCounter_MustOnlyIncrement` in `internal/server/server_test.go`.
- **Prefer MarkRefresh + surgical patches over full BuildUpdate.** When the changed fields are known, use `MarkRefresh(fields...)` then `Refresh()`. This triggers surgical patches (only the bound nodes for those fields are updated) — no tree rebuild, no diff. Full `BuildUpdate` with tree diff is the expensive fallback for when specific changed fields aren't known. See `wireRefresh` in `internal/server/server.go`.
- **All component state access must go through the event queue.** Each component has a buffered `EventCh` channel and a single `processEvents` goroutine. Browser events and background refreshes are serialized through this queue. Never call `handleNodeEvent`, `handleMethodCall`, or `executeRefresh` directly from outside the processor goroutine — always send an event to `EventCh`. One exception uses `ci.Mu` directly: `handleInit` (writes the tree on new connection, must be synchronous so the browser receives the tree before subsequent patches). See `processEvents` in `internal/server/server.go`.
- **Init is pull-based.** On WebSocket connect, the server only pushes `document.body` init (root mode). All other components are initialized on demand: the bridge scans for `[g-component]` elements and sends `BROWSER_INIT_REQUEST` for each. In embedded mode (no `document.body`), the bridge scans on `ws.onopen`. The server injects `window.GODOM_ROOT=true` into the JS bundle so the bridge knows which mode it's in. See `scanAndRequestComponents` in `internal/bridge/bridge.js` and the `BROWSER_INIT_REQUEST` handler in `internal/server/server.go`.
